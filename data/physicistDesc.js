    "Albert Einstein": {
        "Lifespan": "3/14/1879 - 4/18/1955",
        "Popular Contribution": "The Theory of Relativity",
        "Papers Published": "300+",
        "Image": "https://argo.cz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Albert-Einstein1.jpg",
        "Collected": "false",
        "Visible": "false",
        "Description": "Known for his famous equation, e=mc^2, Albert Einstein, would expand the world of Physics further than what was believed to be possible. By 1916, he published his General Theory of Relativity, a successor to his Special Theory of Relativity. After escaping Germany, he would contribute to the initial research of atomic bombs; he later regretted this decision and heavily opposed the existence of nuclear bombs. He would then spend the rest of his career searching for a theory (or set of theories) that would encompass the entire universe."

    "Isaac Newton": {
        "Lifespan": "1/4/1643 - 3/31/1727",
        "Popular Contribution": "Establishment of Classical Mechanics",
        "Papers Published": "8",
        "Image": "https://www.nmspacemuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sir-isaac-newton.jpg",
        "Collected": "false",
        "Visible": "false",
        "Description": "The author of classical mechanics, Isaac Newton, is considered one of the most influential physicists of all time. However, his efforts were not just limited to the field of physics. He changed the scope of mathematics, by developing differential calculus, a core part of today's scientific curriculum. His contributions are some of the most well-known of the field and created the basis for modern physics."
    },

    "Marie Curie": {
        "Lifespan": "11/7/1867 - 7/4/1934",
        "Popular Contribution": "Discovery of Radioactivity",
        "Papers Published": "32",
        "Image": "https://openlysecular.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mariecurie2pic.jpg",
        "Collected": "false",
        "Visible": "false",
        "Description": "After moving from Poland to Paris, Marie Curie began working towards her PhD on the topic of 'uranium rays.' Her and her husband, Pierre Curie, were the first to discover radioactivity, a discovery that would come back to haunt them. In 1934, Marie Curie had become a victim of Leukaemia, which was directly related to her work with radioactivity. As an aside, her notebooks are so radioactive that they must be stored in a lead-lined safe to this day."

    "Pierre Louis de Maupertuis": {
        "Lifespan": "7/17/1689 - 7/27/1759",
        "Popular Contribution": "Principle of Least Action",
        "Papers Published": "14",
        "Image": "https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-yzgoj/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/1566982/4568435/apieli2xs__09946.1626702298.jpg?c=2",
        "Collected": "false",
        "Visible": "false",
        "Description": "The founder of the Principle of Least Action, Pierre Louis de Maupertuis, was not welcomed warmly by many physicists at the time. Many argued that his equation, S_0 = mvs, was random and nonsensical. However, this would later be completely opposite, as it would later unify the various branches of physics. It's implication would reveal the nature of light, classical mechanics, and would extend into quantum mechanics."

    "James Clark Maxwell": {
        "Lifespan": "6/13/1831 - 11/5/1879",
        "Popular Contribution": "Development of Electromagnetic Theory",
        "Papers Published": "101",
        "Image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/James-Clerk-Maxwell-1831-1879.jpg",
        "Collected": "false",
        "Visible": "false",
        "Description": "James Clark Maxwell, the originator of the concept of electromagnetic radiation, is renowned for making contributions on the scale of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein; this is no easy feat. Maxwell formed the basis of what would become Max Planck's quantum hypothesis, a key part in the theoretical development of the microscopic world."
